#### A bot to cheese Neal.fun's Perfect Circle game ([https://neal.fun/perfect-circle](https://neal.fun/perfect-circle))

This project is also on my website, [samrohrbach.space](https://samrohrbach.space). 

In its default state, this is built for a 1366x768 screen in fullscreen. 
To change the location of the center of the circle, edit the `center_y` variable near the top of the script.

### Python script
This script has the following dependencies (install with pip): 
- Time
- Tkinter
- Win10Toast
- PyAutoGUI
- Keyboard
- Math

****

### C++ script
This #includes <Windows.h> and I don't know how to click things or detect keys on Linux, so it would be nice if someone who knows how to do that on Linux could submit a pull request.

### Bash script
This is an incomplete version of CircleClicker written in Bash. It uses `xdotool` to move the mouse.
